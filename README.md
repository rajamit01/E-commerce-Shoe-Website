My First eCommerce Website

This is my very first eCommerce website that I built to learn and practice web development. It’s a simple online store where you can browse products, add them to your cart, and even place orders — just like a real shopping site!

I got this website design from the template i was searching to test my new skills 

What it does
Lets users create an account and log in securely.

Shows a list of products with pictures, prices, and details.

Lets you add items to a shopping cart, change quantities, or remove things.

You can “checkout” and place an order.

Looks good and works well on both phones and computers.

How I built it
I used:

Frontend: (e.g., HTML, CSS, JavaScript — or React if you used it)

Backend: (e.g., Node.js with Express)

Database: (e.g., MongoDB)

Authentication with (JWT / sessions / whatever you used)

How to try it out yourself
Clone the repo:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-ecommerce-repo.git

Go into the folder:
cd your-ecommerce-repo

Install what you need:
npm install (or what fits your project)

Add your environment variables (like database info, secret keys) in a .env file.

Run the server:
npm start

Open your browser at http://localhost:3000 and start exploring!

What I want to add next
Payment system integration (Stripe or PayPal)

User reviews and ratings

Order history page

Make it look even nicer with better design

Deploy it online so anyone can use it

Thanks for checking it out!
Feel free to use this code, give feedback, or help me improve it. I’m excited to keep learning and making this better!
